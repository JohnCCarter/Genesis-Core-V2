## Key Finding

**`authority_mode=regime_module` is the dominant factor.** All 100 trials
in Phase B produced only two distinct outcomes — one per authority_mode value.
Clarity weights (confidence/edge/ev) had zero observable effect on results.

### Root Cause: Two Config Key Bugs in `decision.py`

Investigation revealed two bugs that caused clarity weights and size_multiplier
to be silently ignored:

**Bug 1 — Weights key mismatch (`decision.py:1258`):**
Code read `clarity_cfg.get("weights_v1")` but config stores weights under key
`"weights"`. Result: `weights=None` passed to `compute_clarity_score_v1`, which
fell back to hardcoded defaults `{confidence: 0.5, edge: 0.2, ev: 0.2,
regime_alignment: 0.1}` for ALL trials regardless of Optuna suggestions.

**Bug 2 — Size multiplier wrong lookup (`decision.py:1244-1245`):**
Code read `clarity_cfg.get("size_multiplier_min")` (inside `clarity_score` dict)
but `size_multiplier` is a sibling of `clarity_score` under `regime_intelligence`.
Result: always used defaults `min=0.5, max=1.0` instead of configured values.

**Fix:** Both bugs fixed in commit (see below). `weights` key now read correctly,
`size_multiplier` now read from `ri_cfg` instead of `clarity_cfg`.

**Impact on Phase B v2 results:** These results only reflect the
`authority_mode` difference. Clarity weights and size_multiplier had no effect.
Phase B should be re-run after the fix to get valid results.

Phase A results are unaffected (RI was disabled, `authority_mode=legacy`).

## Phase B v3: Regime Intelligence Re-run After Config-Key Fixes

- **Post-fix artifact evidence:** `config/optimizer/3h/phased_v3/best_trials/phaseB_v3_best_trial.json`
- Best trial: `trial_082`
- This artifact reflects the corrected `weights` + `size_multiplier` lookups.

### Best Trial (trial_082)

| Metric        | In-Sample (2024) |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Score         | 0.3337           |
| Return        | +2.69%           |
| Profit Factor | 2.06             |
| Max Drawdown  | 1.31%            |
| Sharpe Ratio  | 0.252            |
| Trades        | 108              |

### Best Parameters (RI-specific, post-fix)

```yaml
regime_intelligence:
  authority_mode: regime_module
  clarity_score:
    weights:
      confidence: 0.20
      edge: 0.40
      ev: 0.30
      regime_alignment: 0.10
  size_multiplier:
    min: 0.30
    max: 1.00
risk:
  htf_regime_size_multipliers.bear: 0.60
```

### Phase A vs Phase B v3 Comparison (In-Sample 2024)

| Metric | Phase A | Phase B v3 | Delta     |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Score  | 0.1432  | **0.3337** | **+133%** |
| Return | -3.09%  | **+2.69%** | +5.78pp   |
| PF     | 1.37    | **2.06**   | +50%      |
| Max DD | 7.68%   | **1.31%**  | **-83%**  |
| Sharpe | 0.112   | **0.252**  | +125%     |
| Trades | 216     | 108        | -50%      |

**Interpretation:** The post-fix rerun keeps the strong Phase B thesis intact:
RI materially improves score, PF, and drawdown versus Phase A, while producing
similar trade count compression as the earlier v2 run.

## Phase C: OOS Validation After Fixes

- **Artifact evidence:** `config/optimizer/3h/phased_v3/best_trials/phaseC_oos_trial.json`
- Best trial: `trial_001`
- This is the OOS validation for the post-fix Phase B v3 best parameters.

### Best Trial (trial_001)

| Metric        | OOS (2025) |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Score         | 0.1612     |
| Return        | -2.08%     |
| Profit Factor | 1.46       |
| Max Drawdown  | 3.90%      |
| Sharpe Ratio  | 0.122      |
| Trades        | 122        |

### OOS Comparison: Phase A vs Phase B v3 / Phase C

| Metric | Phase A OOS | Phase C OOS | Delta    |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Score  | 0.1031      | **0.1612**  | **+56%** |
| Return | -9.86%      | **-2.08%**  | +7.78pp  |
| PF     | 1.30        | **1.46**    | +12%     |
| Max DD | 12.28%      | **3.90%**   | **-68%** |
| Sharpe | 0.088       | **0.122**   | +39%     |
| Trades | 204         | 122         | -40%     |

**Interpretation:** The corrected RI path remains materially better than the
Phase A baseline in OOS, even though returns stay negative in 2025.

## Evidence Update (2026-03-13)

The corrected RI evidence trail is now split across artifacts rather than fully
captured in the original narrative above:

- historical/stale narrative: Phase B v2 section in this file
- corrected IS artifact: `phaseB_v3_best_trial.json`
- corrected OOS artifact: `phaseC_oos_trial.json`

### Evidence closure update (2026-03-13, `feature/Regime-Intelligence`)

The previously missing study-level reproducibility gap has now been closed with
a fresh branch-local rerun:

- **Phase B rerun:** `results/hparam_search/ri_phaseB_rerun_20260313/`
- **Phase B storage DB:** `results/hparam_search/storage/phased_v3_phaseB_v2_3h.db`
- **Phase C rerun:** `results/hparam_search/ri_phaseC_rerun_20260313/`
- **Phase C rerun DB:** `results/hparam_search/storage/phased_v3_phaseC_rerun_20260313.db`

Observed outcomes from the fresh rerun:

- Phase B again selected **`trial_082`** with score **`0.3336954196`**
- Phase C rerun produced score **`0.1612487234`**

This means the stored post-fix RI narrative is no longer supported only by
standalone JSON artifacts; it is now backed by preserved study/run evidence from
the current branch as well.
