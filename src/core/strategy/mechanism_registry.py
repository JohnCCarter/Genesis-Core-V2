"""Edge-mechanism register (Phase 4, concept lane).

This is a *measurement-honest* container for the causal edge hypotheses the
trading system implicitly bets on. It deliberately does NOT introduce a new
strategy family or any runtime wiring (see CLAUDE.md working-lane model:
"prefer cheaper shapes first: concept lane"; "Do not introduce a new strategy
family merely to give early research a container").

Each mechanism states:
  - the causal claim (why an edge should exist),
  - the surfaces that express it (signal / gates),
  - a falsification condition that, if met, flips its status to REJECTED.

The falsification conditions are deliberately tied to the Phase 1 cost-stress
edge-death thresholds (Sharpe < 1.0, PF < 1.1 at realistic cost) so that the
register stays consistent with how we actually measure edges. Until a mechanism
has direct out-of-sample support it remains UNVERIFIED, which is why the global
EDGE_MAP is UNRESOLVED.
